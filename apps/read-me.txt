To run the app, follow these instructions:

Running json server to host Products REST api
---------------------------------------------
1. Open a command window
2. Change directory to "ng-2017-07-15\apps\db"
3. Run command: json-server --watch store-app-db.json
4. Products api should be available at: http://localhost:3000/products
5. Customers api should be available at: http://localhost:3000/customers

Running Store app
-----------------
1. Open another command window
2. Change directory to "ng-2017-07-15\apps\store-app"
3. Run command: npm install
4. Run command: ng serve
5. Open Chrome browser
6. Go to url: http://localhost:4200

NOTE
----
Currently, the app uses http communication with Products api only. 
As a learner, you will have to study the code for Products and create  
code to complete the Customers portion of the application.

All the best!
Thank you.
